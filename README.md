Hi, I’m a Product Manager and Business Analyst with over 6 years of experience working across the automotive, finance, and healthcare sectors. I focus on turning business problems into practical solutions by using data, strong product thinking, and close collaboration with teams. I’m currently pursuing a Master’s in Data Science to further build on my analytical skills.

I’ve led projects that involved supply chain optimization, loan eligibility automation, and compliance tracking. I enjoy working with SQL, Python, Power BI, and building tools that help teams work smarter.

This GitHub portfolio highlights some of my technical work, including data analysis, automation, and reporting projects that I’ve been part of.
